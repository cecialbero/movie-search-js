## Movie Search App
#### This was a project built by me 5 years ago, a web App to search movies from a json using Ajax and javaScript (No library, no framework). I decided to upgrade the app into version 2, a list of the work in progress:

##### LISTS OF WIP AND TODOS
1. WIP: Revoming AJAX petition to a static json file, instead, I'm doing an async/await call to a movie API (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

2. TODO: Upgrade bootstrap to v5

3. TODO: Include SASS styles with Gulp??

4. TODO: pagination?

5. TODO: checkboxes with options (gender, adults, language)?
