## Movie Search App
#### This was a project built by me 5 years ago, a web App to search movies from a json file using AJAX and javaScript (No library, no framework). I decided to upgrade the app into version 2

##### LISTS OF WIP AND TODOS
1. WIP: Revoming AJAX request to a static json file, instead, I'm doing an async/await call to a movie API (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

3. TODO: Include SASS styles with Gulp??

4. TODO: pagination?

5. TODO: checkboxes with options (gender, adults, language)?

##### LIST OF FIXES DONE IN VERSION 2 SO FAR:
1. Local data.json file removed, new data comes from *themoviedb* API
2. API request is not longer done with AJAX, ASYNC/AWAIT is use instead
2. Bootstrap version upgraded from 3 to 5
